# Current Focus & State: Assassin Game API

## Active Sprint/Cycle
*Assuming current focus is on completing pending high-priority tasks.*

## Recent Changes
*Based on completed tasks in tasks.json.*
- Completed core project setup (Task 1)
- Implemented database schema design (Task 2)
- Implemented User Authentication (Task 3)
- Implemented User Profile Management (Task 4)
- Implemented Game Creation and Management (Task 5)
- Implemented Target Assignment System (Task 7)
- Implemented Elimination Verification System (Task 8)

## Immediate Priorities
*Tasks currently marked as in-progress or high-priority pending.*
1.  **Implement Geolocation and Boundary System (Task 6 - In Progress):** Develop location tracking, geofencing, proximity detection, and safe zones.
    *   Integrate Mapping Service and Basic Geolocation (Subtask 6.1 - Pending)
    *   Implement Geofencing for Game Boundaries (Subtask 6.2 - Pending)
    *   Develop Proximity Detection for Eliminations (Subtask 6.3 - Pending)
    *   Implement Safe Zone System (Subtask 6.4 - Pending)
    *   Secure Location Data Storage and Optimization (Subtask 6.5 - Pending)
2.  **Implement Basic Monetization Infrastructure (Task 9 - Pending):** Setup payment processing for entry fees and basic IAP.
3.  **Implement In-Game Items and Inventory System (Task 10 - Pending):** Manage item catalog, purchases, and usage.
4.  **Implement Subscription Tiers (Task 11 - Pending):** Develop subscription levels and benefits.
5.  **Implement Social Features (Task 12 - Pending):** Leaderboards, friend system, messaging.
6.  **Implement Safety & Moderation Tools (Task 13 - Pending):** Reporting, content moderation, admin tools.
7.  **Implement Notifications System (Task 14 - Pending):** Push notifications for game events.
8.  **Develop API Documentation (Task 15 - Pending):** Create comprehensive documentation.
9.  **Set Up CI/CD Pipeline (Task 16 - Pending):** Automate build, test, and deployment.
10. **Implement Logging and Monitoring (Task 17 - Pending):** Setup CloudWatch logging and metrics.

## Open Questions
*No specific open questions derived from task list, but potential areas:* 
- Specific 3rd party choices (e.g., mapping service, payment processor details beyond Stripe/PayPal).
- Detailed UX flows for specific features.
- Precise scaling targets and testing methodology.

## Blockers
*No specific blockers listed in tasks, but potential dependencies:* 
- Completion of Task 6 (Geolocation) is likely blocking progress on several other features.
- Decisions on specific 3rd party integrations (payment, mapping).

## Recent Learnings
*Derived from the nature of completed tasks.*
- Established core data models and relationships.
- Implemented secure authentication patterns.
- Defined basic game lifecycle management.
- Created initial target assignment logic.
