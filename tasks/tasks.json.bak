Zone Configuration System:\n   - Define a configurable set of shrinking stages (minimum 3-5 stages)\n   - For each stage, specify: duration, final zone size, transition time, and damage amount\n   - Create a visual indicator for the current safe zone and the next zone boundary\n\n2. Zone State Management:\n   - Implement a state machine to handle zone transitions (Waiting, Shrinking, Stable)\n   - Create a timer system to manage stage progression\n   - Develop smooth interpolation for zone shrinking animations\n   - Ensure the zone center can be randomized or predetermined\n\n3. Player Damage System:\n   - Implement a system to detect players outside the safe zone\n   - Apply configurable damage over time to players outside the zone\n   - Add visual and audio feedback when players take zone damage\n   - Include a grace period when a new zone is announced before damage begins\n\n4. Game Integration:\n   - Add the new mode to the game mode selection UI\n   - Implement proper initialization and cleanup for the mode\n   - Create appropriate UI elements showing zone timer, current stage, and warning indicators\n   - Ensure the mode works with existing game systems (respawn, scoring, etc.)\n\n5.

Edge Cases:\n   - Test behavior when players are exactly on the zone boundary\n   - Verify correct behavior when players rapidly enter and exit the zone\n   - Test with minimum and maximum configured zone sizes\n   - Validate behavior when all players are outside the zone\n\n3. Integration Testing:\n   - Verify the mode works correctly with different maps and player counts\n   - Test interaction with other game systems (scoring, respawn, etc.)\n   - Confirm UI elements update correctly as the zone changes\n\n4. Performance Testing:\n   - Measure frame rate impact with maximum player count\n   - Profile memory usage during extended gameplay sessions\n   - Test on minimum specification hardware to ensure acceptable performance\n\n5.
